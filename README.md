# Ben Morgan's Awesome Physics

An awesome list of physics resources with my work in it.

This is a peculiar little repository which is used to track the areas of physics
and which I am studying. Each section outlines a topic in physics that is
recommended to be studied. You can use links to access the material that I used
to study that topic, what my answers were as I studied them, and an open
discussion that I use to reflect on the topic and text.
